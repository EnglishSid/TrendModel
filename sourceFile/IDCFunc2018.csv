",The goal here is to automate the product enhancement process so that the requirements for  procurement are clear and timely.,"Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, 3D Printing","A digital, automated repository of product enhancements and changes - single version of the truth - enables constituents on the business to have a common and timely view. Procurement is thus tied into the typical Change Order process (ECNs) and specification management in a way that enables optimal efficiency both in terms of cost and of speed."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Cost  Optimization ,Automated Product Cost Optimization ,"Procurement has always been a bottom-line motivated function, yet the tools to do proper cost evaluation and optimization are often lacking. Efforts to apply activity-based costing proved to be too time consuming, so averages and standards remain. This means that individual decisions may not be ideal; or specific selections optimize a part of the product cost at the expense of the whole.","Automated product cost optimization provides procurement with the objective, timely and relevant tools they need to make informed and 'total system' product cost (direct procurement) decisions.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","Automated product cost optimization is an automated tool that monitors cost reductions of ECNs, innovation tradeoffs (Make vs. Buy) as well as all costs that make up COGS - materials, logistics, carrying, and fulfillment.  It also addresses network/regional differences while also enabling true optimization on all inputs and offering a forecast of future spending.  "
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Cost  Optimization ,Real-time Invoice Match and Discounts,"Currently, invoice matching (whether receivables or payables) is a mostly manual process with varying degrees of effectiveness. The cost of investigation has also led most companies to write-off amounts less the $500. Visibility has historically been poor. ","Visibility into invoices, invoice discounts, invoice deductions and invoice matching means reconciliation can happen quickly and automatically, freeing humans up to doing more value added tasks.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, RPA, Blockchain","Quite simply an automated tool that matches invoices and takes discounts  and deductions as appropriate. This is a rote task best done by automation and relieves people to do more strategic, value add work while also potentially providing costs savings, improved productivity levels and accuracy (fewer errors)."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Cost  Optimization ,Intelligent Operational Efficiency Capture,"For any function or business process, collecting, capturing and disseminating information is a daunting challenge. In some cases different areas of the business do not communicate well with each other (particularly true in global organizations), in other cases efficiencies may go underappreciated. Either way, the ability to learn from good practices remains inconsistent.",Intelligent operational efficiencies capture automates the capture of efficiencies both in terms of making sure they are 'counted' as well as making sure that the learnings are disseminated across the breadth of procurement.,"Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","Intelligent operational efficiencies capture is the ability to understand both tactical and operational procurement process efficiencies through the use of digital technologies to identify, record and disseminate learnings in real time. Efficient and effectiveness are reasonable outcomes."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Cost  Optimization ,Intelligent Rebate & Discount Capture,"Rebates are currently calculated based on historical shipments and receipts and the reconciled at the end of each quarter.  Discounts are flagged by systems and manually taken.  Record keeping is tedious, manual and consistently reconciled by multiple enterprise personal adding time and expense. ","Intelligent rebates and discount captures automatically in real time and on a continuous basis, rebates for all purchases linked to a rebate program and discounts offered from suppliers.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","P-cards and discounts are intelligently captured in real time, with continuous reconciliation between the buying enterprise and suppliers.   Organizations know the exact rebate and discount amounts and apply to the correct contracts, purchase orders and invoices.

Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Cost  Optimization ,Automated Non-Product Cost Optimization ,"Procurement has always been a bottom-line motivated process, yet the tools to do proper cost evaluation and optimization remain lacking. Efforts to apply activity-based costing proved to be too time consuming, so averages and standards remain. This means that individual decisions may not be ideal; or specific selections optimize a part of the non-product cost at the expense of the whole.","Provide  procurement with the objective, timely and relevant tools they need to make informed and 'total system' non-product cost (indirect procurement) decisions.","Cloud, advanced analytics,blockchain are all enablers here.","Automated non-product cost optimization is an automated tool that monitors cost reductions of ECNs, innovation tradeoffs (Make vs. Buy) as well as all costs that make up indirect. Would also address network/regional differences. The tool would enable true optimization on all inputs and offer a forecast of future spending.  "
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Contracts,Automated Enabled Source to Contract to Signature,"The mechanics of the procurement contracting process are cumbersome and manually intensive; often resulting in delays or even lost/non-executed paperwork. This can mean delays, cost increases, or loss of available supply.",Automating the contracting process means far less likelihood of administrative delays or 'dropping the ball' and a more predictable and reliable process.,"Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","Automation of the full contract authoring to negotiation to signature process means a more consistent and reliable process of executing contracts. This would also include  certificate of insurance/compliance. It would automate the collection of information, in real time, and even enable auto-contracting in authorized instances. Cost and speed are enhanced."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Contracts,Automated Enabled Call-offs to SLA and Contract,"As enterprises have become global (both in terms of customers and suppliers) the necessity of driving efficiency through global contracts has become de rigeur. The requirements of these contracts, however, can become burdensome in the sense that contracted quantities may not be fully met - either because the volumes targets were off or because non-sanctioned, alternative supply was used. Either way, penalty fees may ensue.","Automated call offs and SLA processes identify authorized suppliers and prevents 'rogue' procurement. As supply is required, automated call-offs ensure that service-level-agreements are adhered to and contracts fulfilled.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","A digitally-enabled contract manager enables automated call offs to the required supply contract obligations ensuring that the proper suppliers are used and that service-level agreements are met. This impacts Inventory, orders, contract renewals and even sunset clauses, and optimizes cost and avoids unnecessary penalty fees."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Procurement & Supply Planning,"Intelligent Inventory, Planning & Routing","Most procurement inventory, planning and routing processes are disconnected and not integrated into a broad pan-supply chain view that includes service levels and optimal sourcing points. This creates inefficiency, often with negative implications for factory performance and eventual OTIF.",Intelligent inventory planning and routing aims to fully integrate the procurement functions into the planning and execution elements of the supply chain so that 'smart' decisions can be made in real time for sourcing locations and options.,"Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data, predictive/prescriptive analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive, Blockchain","The intelligent optimization for inventory, planning and routing from either localized or remote sources, enables cost-effective and proactive processes.  In addition the optimization  for inputs required for the factory  and identifies the ideal routing of items and  quantities to the point of consumption.  This means better factory utilization and improvement in OTIF."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Procurement & Supply Planning,Digital Ecosystem VMI,"Traditional Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI) processes have been manually intensive, with VMI 'planners' tasked with identifying current inventory levels at customer sites, overlaid with the best available demand plans to develop an appropriate fulfillment schedule. The manual nature of this process makes it quite cumbersome and often imprecise - leading many to abandon the effort.","Digital Ecosystem VMI is envisioned as a next-generation form of VMI where modern visibility and AI driven decision-making replaces the old, manual process. VMI  removes unnecessary limitations and flaws, driving up value and drives down administrative cost.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive","This use case means dynamic visibility into inventory consumption and capacity utilization at customer/replenishment sites with automated reordering and fulfillment based on the most recent iteration of consumer demand. This means a more efficient VMI process, with more accurate and timely replenishment shipments to ensure higher levels of in-stock and optimal levels of inventory."
Procurement,Digitizing Procurement & Partnerships,Intelligent Procurement & Supply Planning,Digital Procurement Assistant,"Procurement is largely still a manual effort. Digital data sources are used but many decisions made by procurement professionals are based on experience, instinct, and gut feel when calculating the balance between supply and demand. While this has generally worked for many companies, it is far from ideal, certainly not optimized and rarely done in real time.","A digital procurement assistant augments the human procurement professional by automating rote tasks and ensuring that they are done quickly and in a timely fashion. Relieving the procurement professional from these repetitive tasks allows them to focus on much more strategic, value-added tasks.","Enterprise Hardware, Personal devices, Cloud, Big data/analytics, Mobile, Applications, Connectivity Services, Cognitive","The digital procurement assistant enables automated ordering from suppliers, auctions, or supply base/catalogues; makes informed tradeoff decisions between various sources of supply (such as a supplier with inventory vs. others for exception management based on % of ability to fulfill ) all in real-time and as a complement to the employee.
