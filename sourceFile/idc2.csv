Smart City,Outcome-Based Urban Digital Transformation,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Smart Infrastructure and Operations,Multimodal transit hubs,"Transit hubs are multimodal centers for passengers across different transport services (bus, long-distance bus, rail, taxi, car share, bicycle, etc.) and integrate real-time information such as arrival time and amenities such as restrooms, food, WiFi, and shelter. Fare media and payment systems could also be included.","A transit hub centralizes services and makes transfers between modes and routes easier and creates a gravity of activity at a specific place. It also could provide shelter, heat, and WiFi, making the transit experience more comfortable and productive.","Mobile apps, GPS, and WiFi","Transit hubs are developing in cities throughout the world ? some as simple as a ""bus transfer place"" with overhead roofs and bus lanes. However, more advanced hubs are full buildings with restrooms and services including WiFi and food. A successful transit center not only makes transfers between routes or modes easier but may increase ridership, improving access to a location while reducing demand for parking spaces."
Smart City,Outcome-Based Urban Digital Transformation,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Smart Infrastructure and Operations,Intelligent traffic management,"Congestion in cities is worsening. Building new highway lanes generally leads to even more traffic, not less congestion. Smart signaling can help the flow of traffic, remotely or via sensors, allowing a signal sequence to be altered to alleviate congestion at a location. Data from drivers plus cameras and sensors can feed into a traffic management center (local government) or other service (like Waze or Google) to process and return data to drivers in real time to operate their route accordingly to bypass or minimize traffic congestion.","Traffic management seeks to minimize congestion on the roadway system, allowing traffic to flow smoothly, ensuring time reliability of the roadway, and minimizing unwanted vehicle emissions into the atmosphere. Safety matter (ice, fog, etc.) can also be identified and transmitted in real time to approaching drivers/vehicles.","Cameras, speed sensors, other sensors (e.g., weather, traction), analytics, mobile phones, mobile apps, GPS, and connected vehicles","Traffic management systems work to minimize traffic congestion by keep traffic flowing by ensuring traffic signals function to real-time situations and by broadcasting to cloud-based services areas of congestion (e.g., from construction, an accident, or general rush-hour traffic). Services already exist, and as technology develops, more devices and services will be connected, such as traffic signals and cars themselves that could broadcast speed data without the use of street-based sensors, which will further enhance traffic management. In addition, unsafe conditions, such as ice or fog, can be transmitted to a vehicle in real time."

Provides new mobility in a space that was lacking public transit-like services.,"Mobile apps, mobile payments, routing analysis, and GPS","Ride hailing (and to a lesser extent, ride sharing) has transformed mobility options in cities, providing services where options beyond driving one's self were limited as transit and taxis were limited or not practical; and walking or bicycling was also not feasible or practical. It also makes life without car ownership more possible for many who lived in car-only dependent areas. Further, lack of car ownership can transform and enhance urban living, in part through increased densities from less stringent minimum parking requirements."

Government,Efficient and Effective Services and Outcomes,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,Drone-based travel and transportation,"Development of drone-based travel is currently under way using single-occupancy vehicles that fly short distances. As traffic congestion increases in cities, drones offer the possibility of flying over the traffic and a constrained street grid. ""Flying cars,"" as human-carrying drones are sometimes called, are currently under testing, with an increasing number of companies entering this space. Regulatory and operational developments are required for full-scale adoption of this mode, but these are under way, as well as vehicles are already under piloting.",Facilitate transportation of people and goods that avoids traffic congestion and the street grid network. Reductions in vehicle traffic would also reduce road maintenance costs.,"Drone technology, GPS, sensors, wireless communications, intelligence at the edge, IoT, cloud-enabled analytics, mobile device apps to request and enter ride information","Flying cars will allow fast transport across a city, bypassing traffic below as well as the constraints of a street grid. Drone travel also reduces the number of vehicles on streets. The technology is currently under way and in piloting, though widespread adoption faces regulatory hurdles."
Government,Efficient and Effective Services and Outcomes,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,Smart airports,"Airports are becoming increasingly connected, providing efficiencies for airport operators and airline tenants and with user benefits for passengers. Currently, core functions of operations and passenger uses remain generally siloed using dedicated and legacy systems.","Improve airport operations through centralized and connected services for airport terminal, airfield ground operations, and landside operations, as well as enhanced connectivity and services for airline passengers in terminals.","GPS, sensors, wireless communications, intelligence at the edge, WiFi, Bluetooth, IoT, cloud-enabled analytics, mobile","Smart airport innovations can be implemented from landside (nonsecure portions) to passenger terminals and airfield operations, benefitting airport operators, airlines, retailers, and airline passengers through enhanced connectivity, data, and analytics for more efficient operations, better data, and enhanced passenger experiences."
Government,Efficient and Effective Services and Outcomes,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Smart Infrastructure and Operations,Connected ports and marine transport,Ports and marine travel are employing more smart technology to increase cargo movement efficiency in ports and more connected and easier fare payment on ferries.,Secure and efficient passenger and cargo movements through ports and ferry terminals.,"GPS, sensors, wireless communications, WiFi, IoT, cloud-enabled analytics, mobile, SMS, Bluetooth, NFC",IoT and connectivity are enhancing marine shipping and waterborne passenger activities for more efficient and more secure operations at ports. (Customs and immigration/border control activities are not part of this use case.)
Government,Efficient and Effective Services and Outcomes,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Smart Infrastructure and Operations,Next-generation rail,"Enhanced networking connectivity on board trains is allowing for better crew operations as well as enhanced experiences for passengers. In addition, connectivity to command centers allow for better operational control and improved data resources for management.","Improved operations for train crew, ground operations personnel, management, and enhanced passenger service with arrival/departure information, payment capabilities, and on-board services.","GPS, sensors, wireless communications, WiFi, IoT, cloud-enabled analytics, mobile, SMS, Bluetooth, NFC","Next-generation rail incorporates improved railway operations for train crews and operations personnel at stations and command centers, as well as better data and analytics for management, and enhanced passenger services with real-time train services, fare payment capabilities, and onboard services."
Government,Efficient and Effective Services and Outcomes,no value,Intelligent Transportation,Smart Infrastructure and Operations,Next-generation air traffic control,"In some countries, waypoints on the ground are still used as navigational aids despite the presence of satellites and GPS that could allow for more efficient routings that allow for more efficient air traffic control. Next-generation air traffic control systems are under way.",Modernizing of air traffic control systems for safer air travel and more efficient movement of aircraft en route and for departure and arrival procedures.,"Automatic Dependent Surveillance?Broadcast, transponders, avionics, satellites, data communications, VoIP","Modernizing a national or regional airspace with the latest navigational and communications technology enhances safety in the skies as well as the efficient routing of aircraft, which results in savings in fuel; passenger, crew, and aircraft time; and fuel emissions into the environment."
