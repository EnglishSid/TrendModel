Real-time crime centers,"For most cities- responding and investigating crime is an overly manual- HR-intensive- nonautomated process that inefficiently connects the dots between various departments- resources- and/or jurisdictions. Time delays frequently lead to loss of life- unapprehended criminals- and the perpetuation of further crime as a result. A variety of ""real-time centers"" ? real-time intelligence centers (RTICs)- real-time operations centers (RTOCs)- and real-time crime centers (RTCCs) ? have emerged to manage timely information integration.

There is very little flexibility or differentiation of services- often leading to customer frustration.,Enterprise mobility.  (mobile applications,data,security,device management).  Unified communications. User-accessible WiFi.  Concierge (greeter) technologies (calendaring,queuing,customer authentication).  Integrated automated ,staffed systems.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Chatbot service,Traditionally- product/service selectors in the online bank have been limited and require additional assistance to be usable. However- online banking users have limited capability to seek and receive support without abandoning the web interface and using telephone resources (or visits to the branch). This leads to frustration for the customer and a loss of opportunity for the bank to engage and expand the relationship with the customer.,Cognitive capabilities against comprehensive customer information systems for retail customers,small business owners,corporate clients.

Location services that will be important in the next generation of mobility.  Multimedia capabilities,driven by enterprise content management,to enrich the mobile experience. ,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Contextual marketing,The bank's lines of business are typically separated by organizational and technological barriers that prevent the institution from treating customers holistically across the enterprise. This has an associated negative impact of disparate marketing campaigns that apply to- at best- broad customer categories (retail- small business- etc.). In addition- these programs are hard to measure and don't lend themselves to quick responses to market needs.,Enterprise data architectures,Anonymization of personally identifiable information to support cloud-based analytics,Omni-experience architectures to deliver marketing messages to appropriate devices at the right time ,with security ,compliance,Graphic user dashboards to show patterns ,trends that are difficult to see from raw data.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,

Full customer payment visibility,Currently- retail payments are separated by line of business. Information about payments made by credit- debit- ACH- and so forth are held within those lines of business- so financial institutions (FIs) have little information on overall spend patterns and behavior.,Service-oriented architecture,Mobile,Big data/analytics.  ,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
P2P payments,Consumer-to-consumer payments are largely reliant on cash and checks. Payment types include splitting rent and utilities or paying babysitters or lawn services. Paper-based payment types are slow- insecure- and inefficient.,Mobility,Biometric authentication,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,

Least cost routing,The separation of payment products by line of business also means that payments that could be handled through less expensive means will often be routed across pricier options (credit- wire- etc.).,Service-oriented architecture,big data/analytics,cognitive,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Customer selection and balance sheet optimization,Data-driven customer selection is rare including regulation-adjusted client value- as product silos limit internal evaluation of client profitability- exposure- and risk.  Most banks struggle to move beyond the widely available product-by-product economics to determine the profitability of an individual client.,Big data/analytics ,machine learning to drive predictive analytics,such as scenario modeling based on economic growth,regulations,willingness to adjust loan portfolio,risk exposure of the client.  Early warning system of credit-quality deterioration among clients.

"Strategic, data-driven pricing optimization",Margin contraction- growing competition- and the ongoing low-interest environment force corporate banks to optimize their pricing strategy to maximize revenue and drive customer loyalty.  Pricing discretion of relationship managers versus company pricing policies cause massive fluctuation in revenue- inconsistent client satisfaction- and suboptimal pricing strategies.  There is a lack of understanding of client price sensitivity.  Reactive pricing (reply to RFPs) and revenue maximization (hit product sales targets) dominate instead of a proactive strategy with the customer's benefit at heart.,Big data/analytics to optimize pricing ,analyze external data,Machine learning to forecast ,optimize campaign profitability ,personalize the offering to individual clients,Real-time competitive intelligence monitoring.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
"API-based partner, supplier, and customer ecosystems",Today's bank-centric ecosystem is expensive for banks to manage and inconvenient- slow- and tedious for customers- suppliers- and partners to access.  Host-to-host connectivity dominates corporate-to-bank connectivity. This makes onboarding new customers expensive and lengthy- while customers struggle to integrate data to get a cross-bank view of their financial position. Payments also remain an often manual and opaque process for corporates.  Organizations often focus on digitizing their own processes- but face barriers connecting with other digital entities.,Enterprise digital platform,APIs,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
DLT-based trade finance networks,Trade finance and supply chain finance involve highly complex- often manual and paper-based processes that haven't benefited much from the digitalization of the industry. Hence the digitalization of international trade remains a priority for manufacturers- importers- exporters- authorities- logistics- insurers- and trade finance organizations. However- stakeholder diversity- the complexity of international supply chains- and regulations have been met with too little and too fragmented investments to automate trade. With too many different options available- a clear direction is not yet in sight.  Today- trade finance remains one of the most opportunistic areas within corporate and commercial banking to leverage DLT technology. As a result- almost every tier 1 bank is experimenting by itself or in a consortium to digitize trade.  ,Distributed ledger technology,Smart contracts to reduce friction ,risk,Connected devices for asset tracking,BDA,Digital platform ,APIs,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Crowdlending,Today's traditional credit models have limited the banks' ability and appetite to extend credit to SMEs and high-risk borrowers due to strict regulatory requirements.  As a result- SMEs and start-ups do not have access to sufficient funding- which stifles innovation. Banks only slowly extend more credit to these segments- and as a result- alternative sources of funding such as venture capital- private equity- and P2P platforms close the gap.,New settlement platforms,Cloud,Digital platforms,APIs,New risk scoring models,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Cash management as a service,Sales staff is often not proactively assessing client needs but merely reactive to request for proposals (RFPs) from corporate customers. Campaigns are usually product centric- not needs based.  As a result- most corporate banks purely push products without offering customized advice that clients seek.  Relationship teams are incentivized to focus on short-term sales- which often is not in the client's best interest.  Customer understanding is lacking due to poor customer intelligence.,BDA ,machine learning,APIs,Account aggregation,Scenario modeling,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Retail customer onboarding,Firms must conduct know your customer (KYC) and customer due diligence (CDD) for onboarding new retail and small business customers.

Fraud transaction monitoring,Financial firms are under constant threat from a myriad of bad actors that are looking to get access to customer accounts and funds. Firms are also facing increasing pressure from regulators to be more proactive to detect and prevent fraud. In regulatory reports and examinations- firms must be able to document how they are assembling their data and implementing their transaction monitoring analysis to reduce fraud at their institutions.,Advanced analysis tools including machine learning ,natural language processing to look for new ,actionable patterns of through the analysis words ,phrases that could be signs of employees involved in suspicious activities ,actively working to avoid detection ,arrest (For example,anomaly detection to analyze communications that use odd word choices ,phrasing for a given situation or transaction.),-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Regulatory compliance reporting,Firms must aggregate data from silos inside the firm and combine it with data from outside sources. Many firms struggle to meet regulator expectations to provide more detailed periodic and ad hoc regulatory reporting on consumer accounts.,Advanced analytics such as machine learning,natural language processing,cognitive analysis,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Monitor staff communication,Firms are responsible for the conduct of their employees and must ensure that they protect their customers' funds- transaction data- and personal information. This protection includes bad actors outside as well as employees inside the firm. Firms must monitor communications for signs of illegal or suspicious activity. This is increasing difficult as bad actors get more creative to avoid detection and arrest and use combinations of digital communications as well as code words and phrases to avoid detection and arrest.,To stay ahead of rogue employees that may be working alone,with other employees or with their customers to commit crimes,firms should aggregate data from lines of business ,combine it with external information (e.g.,social media). There have been multiple regulatory actions against firms that had employees that used code words to signify their intent as part of their schemes to collude to defraud customers ,investors. Advanced text analytics ,machine learning can help firms analyze huge amounts of data more quickly than keyword or key phrase watch lists.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,

Bad actors can use their access to systems and information to steal funds- sensitive company data- and customer identity information.,Advanced analytics include machine learning,natural language processing,cognitive analysis.,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,
Business Logic,In most banks- the logic needed to run the products and services are locked in monolithic core banking systems that are difficult- if not impossible- to change or modify without undue risk and long time frames. This prevents the lines of business from responding in a timely (and efficient) manner to market changes.,RESTful API Description Languages,Cloud-based app dev,API Testing platforms,Modular core processing systems,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,

RPA for Operational Support,Most noncustomer processes in the institution were built before the latest transformational technologies were adopted (cloud- mobile- etc.). At best- this increases the complexity in the infrastructure as work-arounds and temporary (often manual) solutions are put in place.
